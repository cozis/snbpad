** DESCRIPTION
**   Transform a UTF-32 encoded codepoint to a UTF-8 encoded byte sequence.
**
** ARGUMENTS
**   The [utf8_data] pointer refers to the location where the UTF-8 sequence
**   will be stored.
**
**   The [nbytes] argument specifies the maximum number of bytes that can
**   be written to [utf8_data]. It can't be negative.
**
**   The [utf32_code] argument is the UTF-32 code that will be converted.
**
** RETURN
**   If [utf32_code] is valid UTF-32 and the provided buffer is big enough, 
**   the UTF-8 equivalent sequence is stored in [utf8_data]. No more than
**   [nbytes] are ever written. If one of those conitions isn't true, -1 is
**   returned.

**   xutf8_sequence_to_utf32_codepoint
**
** DESCRIPTION
**   Transform a UTF-8 encoded byte sequence pointed by `utf8_data`
**   into a UTF-32 encoded codepoint.
**
** ARGUMENTS
**   The [utf8_data] pointer refers to the location of the UTF-8 sequence.
**
**   The [nbytes] argument specifies the maximum number of bytes that can
**   be read after [utf8_data]. It can't be negative. 
**
**   NOTE: The [nbytes] argument has no relation to the UTF-8 byte count sequence. 
**         You may think about this argument as the "raw" string length (the one 
**         [strlen] whould return if [utf8_data] were zero-terminated). 
**
**   The [utf32_code] argument is the location where the encoded UTF-32 code
**   will be stored. It may be NULL, in which case the value is evaluated and then
**   thrown away.
**
** RETURN
**   The codepoint is returned through the output parameter `utf32_code`.
**   The returned value is the number of bytes of the UTF-8 sequence that
**   were scanned to encode the UTF-32 code, or -1 if the UTF-8 sequence
**   is invalid.
**
** NOTE: By calling this function with a NULL [utf32_code], you can check the
**       validity of a UTF-8 sequence.
